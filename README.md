# Optimization

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Decision Analytics for Business & Policy**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. It demonstrates the use of modeling frameworks and computational tools to address complex, ill-defined and large-scale decision-making problems that arise in policy and business. 

The work done here involves advanced methods of decision-making: deterministic optimization (large-scale), stochastic/robust optimization, and sequential decision-making. Different case problems from a variety of real-world settings have been solved here, along with a final project. Links for each of these components have been provided below.

# What I hope to learn?
From the course, Decision Analytics for Business and Policy, I wish to learn how to design end-to-end decision analytics pipelines, by:

1. Identifying components of decision problems that are (not) susceptible to analytical modeling, and selecting the appropriate tools.
2. Translating decision problems to logical, mathematical formulations, and clearly identifying the objectives, decision variables, constraints, input/output.
3. Translating these mathematical formulations into code using Python.
4. Applying findings back to the decision problem context in business and policy through written and verbal communication.
